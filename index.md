# About me
I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Dr. Trevor Keenan at the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM). I  obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Science at the University of Denver in 2021, with minors in Mathematics and Leadership.  

## Research intetests
I study the interactions between climate and terrestrial ecosystem carbon fluxes by synthesizing large ecological datasets and applying novel machine-learning approaches. As all living cells respire, respiration is one of the ecosystem's two largest natural carbon fluxes besides photosynthesis. My Ph.D. focuses are modeling, partitioning, and upscaling ecosystem respiration using global eddy covariance and remote sensing data

Key words: Ecosystem Carbon Flux Modeling, Eddy-covariance, Ecosystem Respiration, Vegetation Productivity, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Models, Time Series Classification/Forecasting

## Fun facts
I am the 2nd Vietnamese who collected marine samples under Arctic polar nights, I have been working as a government interpreter, and Rock climbing is my favorite sport
